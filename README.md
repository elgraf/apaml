# digit-draw-recognize

This is my project on digit recognition. You draw a digit and models try to recognize it. There are two models: FNN on numpy and CNN on Tensorflow. Also models not simply recognize digits, but also train on them. As a result quality of predictions continue improving.
The site works on desktop and mobile.

You can find descriptions of the models and the project itself on the site.
